    <h1>Glycemic Index</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>
      The <b>Glycemic Index (GI)</b> is a ranking system that classifies
      carbohydrate-containing foods based on how quickly they raise blood
      glucose levels. Foods are scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with pure glucose
      (which rapidly spikes blood sugar) set at a reference point of 100. Foods
      are typically classified into three categories:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Low GI (0-55)</b>: Foods that are digested, absorbed, and metabolized
        slowly, leading to a gradual increase in blood glucose. Examples include
        lentils, nuts, and many fruits and vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Medium GI (56-69)</b>: Foods that have a moderate effect on blood
        sugar. Examples include bananas, quick oats, and brown rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>High GI (70 and above)</b>: Foods that cause a rapid spike in blood
        glucose. Examples include white bread, potatoes, and sugary beverages.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <br />

    <h3>Why GI Matters:</h3>
    <p>
      The <b>GI</b> helps people, especially those managing diabetes or aiming
      to maintain steady energy levels, choose foods that minimize blood sugar
      spikes. Low-GI foods can improve satiety, support weight management, and
      reduce the risk of insulin resistance. However, itâ€™s also essential to
      consider portion size and overall nutrition, as some low-GI foods may be
      high in fats or calories.
