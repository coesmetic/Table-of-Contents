    <h1>Total Carbs vs Net Carbs</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>
      <b>Total Carbs</b> and <b>Net Carbs</b> are two different ways to measure
      the carbohydrate content of food:
    </p>

    <br />

    <h3>Total Carbs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Definition</b>: Total carbs encompass the entire carbohydrate content
        in a food item, which includes sugars, starches, and dietary fiber.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What It Includes</b>: All digestible and non-digestible carbs, as
        listed on nutrition labels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Impact</b>: Since total carbs include all carbohydrates regardless of
        their effect on blood sugar, this count may overestimate how many carbs
        actually impact blood glucose levels.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Net Carbs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Definition</b>: Net carbs (or effective carbs) refer to the
        carbohydrates that are actually digested and impact blood sugar levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What It Includes</b>: Net carbs are calculated by subtracting fiber
        and some sugar alcohols (like erythritol) from total carbs. These
        components don’t significantly impact blood sugar because they are
        either not absorbed by the body or absorbed differently.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Why It Matters</b>: Net carbs are especially relevant for those on
        low-carb or ketogenic diets or those managing blood sugar, as they
        provide a more accurate measure of how many carbs are truly “available”
        for energy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Differences</h3>
    <table bgcolor="black" width="750px">
      <tr bgcolor="grey" align="center">
        <th>Aspect</th>
        <th>Total Carbs</th>
        <th>Net Carbs</th>
      </tr>
      <tr bgcolor="grey" align="center">
        <td><b>Includes</b></td>
        <td>All sugars, starches, and fiber</td>
        <td>Only carbs that impact blood sugar</td>
      </tr>
      <tr bgcolor="grey" align="center">
        <td><b>Used By</b></td>
        <td>General nutrition guidelines, food labeling</td>
        <td>Low-carb diets, diabetic meal planning</td>
      </tr>
      <tr bgcolor="grey" align="center">
        <td><b>Impact on Blood Sugar</b></td>
        <td>May overestimate carb effect on blood sugar</td>
        <td>Reflects more accurate blood sugar impact</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
    <p>If a food item has:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>20g total carbs</li>
      <li>5g fiber</li>
      <li>5g of certain sugar alcohols like erythritol (if applicable)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Total Carbs</b>: 20g</li>
      <li>
        <b>Net Carbs</b>: 20g - 5g fiber - 5g sugar alcohols = 10g net carbs
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br />

    <p>
      This concept helps people better tailor their diet to their needs,
      especially in managing blood sugar or maintaining ketosis.
