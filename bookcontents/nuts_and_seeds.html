        <b>Carbohydrate Content</b>: Nuts and seeds vary, with almonds, pecans,
        and walnuts containing 1-4 grams of net carbs per ounce, while
        higher-carb nuts like cashews have around 8 grams per ounce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Fiber Content</b>: The high fiber content in most nuts and seeds
        helps lower the net carb count, and they also provide healthy fats and
        protein, making them popular on low-carb diets.
