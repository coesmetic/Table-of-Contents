      <b>Carbohydrates</b> are a primary source of energy in the human diet,
      essential for supporting bodily functions and physical activity.
      Structurally, they are organic compounds made up of <b>carbon</b>,
      <b>hydrogen</b>, and <b>oxygen</b>, and are classified into three main
      types: <b>sugars</b>, <b>starches</b>, and <b>fibers</b>. Sugars, also
      known as simple carbohydrates, provide quick energy, while starches and
      fibers, or complex carbohydrates, deliver sustained energy and play
      crucial roles in digestion and heart health. Commonly found in foods like
      <b>grains</b>, <b>fruits</b>, and <b>vegetables</b>, carbohydrates are
      broken down into glucose, which cells use for fuel. While they are vital
      for energy, the type and amount of carbohydrate consumed are important for
      overall health.
