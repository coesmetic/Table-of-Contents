        <b>Carbohydrate Content</b>: Bread varies widely in carb content; white
        and whole-wheat breads typically have around 12-20 grams per slice,
        while low-carb and “keto” breads contain 5 grams or less per slice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Types</b>: Whole grain and sprouted breads offer more fiber, which
        can lower net carbs slightly, while refined white breads generally
        provide fewer nutrients and more net carbs.
