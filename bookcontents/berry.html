        <b>Carbohydrate Content</b>: Berries like strawberries, raspberries, and
        blackberries are lower in carbs than most fruits, with around 5-15 grams
        of carbs per cup, depending on the type.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Net Carbs</b>: Their high fiber content reduces net carbs, especially
        in blackberries and raspberries, which makes them a popular low-carb
        fruit choice.
