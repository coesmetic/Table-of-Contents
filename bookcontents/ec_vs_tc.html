    <h1>Effective Carbs vs Total Carbs</h1>

    <hr />

    <p>
      <b>Total Carbs</b> refers to the complete amount of carbohydrates in a
      food item, including all sugars, starches, and dietary fiber. On nutrition
      labels, this figure represents the sum of all carbohydrate components,
      giving a full picture of carbohydrate content. However,
      <b>Effective Carbs</b>
      (also called Net Carbs) refers specifically to the amount of carbohydrates
      that impact blood sugar levels. This measure subtracts fibers and certain
      sugar alcohols (like erythritol) from the total carb count, as they
      generally do not raise blood glucose levels or significantly contribute
      calories.

    <h3>Why This Matters:</h3>
    <p>
      For those following low-carb diets or managing blood sugar, focusing on
      effective carbs can help avoid spikes while still allowing for fiber and
      non-impactful carbs in the diet.
